# Milestone 3

## Features Completed

* Most of the HTML/CSS is done for the front end.
* We can move our character around the room.
* We have a game for demonstration purposes. (It's not what we'll ultimately use.)

## What Worked

* The visual aspects of the front end are working.
* We have a script and a design document for our database. These will both change.

## Issues

* Learning curves are steep.
  * The Phaser game library seems easy to use, but it's difficult to learn everything that we need to learn.
  * Writing the SQL script isn't too difficult, but thinking about how best to design the database is difficult.
* Integrating each other's work is difficult.
  * We all have working parts, and now our job is to integrate those parts into a seamless whole.

## Suggestions

* We need to have a consistent look and feel. (Everything looks different at this point because we're all making our own parts.)
* We need to integrate all of the parts that have been worked on thus far.
* An easy next step is to connect the sign in and sign up pages to the database. We then need to connect the rest of the front end to the database.
