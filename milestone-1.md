## Application Name

Virtual Casino / Virtual Arcade / Virtual Game Center

(All of the above are working names.)

## Application Description

We want to make an app/website where you can create a character who moves around in a virtual room and plays casino games like poker, blackjack, etc.

### We want the user to be able to:

* create an account with an email and a password;
* delete their account;
* reset their password;
* create a character, i.e. customize their hair, outfit, etc.;
* move the character around in a room with game tables;
* play games like poker, blackjack, war, etc.;
* keep track of their score and the score of other players;
* earn virtual currency for winning a game;
* earn badges for accomplishing certain things, like winning a poker tournament;
* buy things for their character in a virtual store; and
* have a profile with the number of games they've played, the number of times they've won, badges, etc.

### Our "stretch" goals have to do with multiplayer functionality:

 * Stage 1: scoreboard (core)
 * Stage 2: see others on the map (live)
 * Stage 3: interact with others (live)

We hope that our users will enjoy customizing their character and playing games.

## Vision Statement

For gamers who enjoy custom characters and casino games, the Virtual Game Center is a casino game website that allows them to play many of their favorite games. Unlike many other casino game websites, our product allows the user to create a customizable virtual character that interacts with its virtual environment, the game center.

## Development Principles and Methodology

We would like to use an Agile Scrumban (Scrum + Kanban) methodology. Since we have such a small timeframe in which to do this project, we've decided that Agile makes sense as a set of principles to guide the project. As for our methodology, we want to use a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban. We'll create small teams to work on portions of the website in sprints, and we'll use Github's built-in Kanban system to help keep track of work that needs to be done.

## Communication Plan

We've created a group text for planning and logistics. We've created a Slackspace for communicating while working and for sharing files and such.

## Proposed Architecture

We'd like to use:

* a progressive web app (PWA) or a website for our frontend;
* Pygame for some of the more difficult-to-implement things related to moving the character around, play the games, etc.;
* Python (probably Django, but maybe Flask) for our integration layer;
* if we use Django, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, or Oracle for backend, if not Django then maybe MongoDB or some other NoSQL database for backend; and
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting.

## Meeting Plan

We will meet once weekly. We all have time on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 1 PM to 3 PM. Some of us will probably meet in small groups for sprints throughout the semester, but we'll coordinate those events as they arise.
